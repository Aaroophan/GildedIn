# GildedIn

GildedIn is a cutting-edge, no-code portfolio platform designed to empower professionals, creatives, and developers with an instantly generated, highly customizable, and visually stunning web presence. 

Leveraging the power of **Next.js 16**, **React 19**, and **Three.js**, GildedIn transforms static profiles into dynamic, interactive experiences. It eliminates the technical barrier to entry for building personal websites, offering users a dedicated URL structure (e.g., `domain.com/Username`) populated with rich, modular content sections.

## 🚀 Overview

The core philosophy of GildedIn is **"Instant Presence, Infinite Style."** 

Upon registration, the system automatically provisions a comprehensive portfolio suite for the user. This includes nested routing for distinct professional facets—such as Projects, Experience, and Education—all wrapped in a responsive, high-performance interface. The platform supports real-time editing, allowing users to tweak their details and visual settings via an intuitive dashboard, with changes reflected instantly across their public profile.

Distinctive from standard portfolio builders, GildedIn deeply integrates 3D graphics and sophisticated animations, making every profile feel premium ("Gilded") and unique.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Routing Architecture
- **Personalized URLs**: Every user receives a unique namespace `/[username]`.
- **Nested Sections**: dedicated sub-routes for content depth:
  - `/[username]/About`
  - `/[username]/Projects`
  - `/[username]/Experience`
  - `/[username]/Education`
  - `/[username]/Contact`
  - `/[username]/Blog`
  - `/[username]/Technologies`
  - `/[username]/Reference`

### 2. Immersive Visual Experience
- **3D Integration**: Built-in support for 3D scenes and objects using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`.
- **Advanced Animations**: Smooth page transitions and element interactions powered by `framer-motion`.
- **Interactive UI**: Elements react to user input with effects like parallax tilt (`react-parallax-tilt`) and glow effects (`@codaworks/react-glow`).

### 3. Modular Content System
- **Component-Based Sections**: Each part of the portfolio is a self-contained module, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
- **Detailed Project Views**: Interactive project cards that expand into detailed modals or dedicated views.

### 4. Application Architecture
- **State Management**: Centralized state management using **Redux Toolkit** for predictable data flow.
- **Authentication**: Secure client-side authentication handling via `useAuth` hook and `AuthService`.
- **Mock Login Capability**: Includes a robust mock login flow for development and testing purposes (Test Credentials: `arophn@gmail.com` / `TEST1234`).
